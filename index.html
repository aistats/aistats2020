<p>Since its inception in 1985, AISTATS has been an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and related areas.</p>

<p> <br>Message regarding the outbreak of COVID-19 from March 7th 2020:<br>

We currently intend to hold the conference in Palermo on June 3rd - 5th as originally planned.
This is not an easy decision at this time, and we considered several alternatives, including turning the conference into an online event, postponing it, and canceling it.

The safety and wellbeing of the conference participants is our top priority. We are continuously updated on the COVID-19 situation from local authorities and the World Health Organization. 
We currently believe that the dates of the conference are sufficiently ahead of time to give reasonable likelihood that the situation will be much improved by the time that the conference will take place.
We will continue to monitor the situation, and we will remain ready to address in the most appropriate way any travel restrictions for the participants and new developments.
