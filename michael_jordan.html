<h1>Towards a Blend of Machine Learning and Microeconomics</h1>
<h2>Michael I. Jordan, University of California, Berkeley</h2>
<p>
Statistical decisions are often given meaning in the context of other decisions,
particularly when there are scarce resources to be shared.  Managing such sharing
is one of the classical goals of microeconomics, and it is given new scope in the
modern setting of large, human-focused datasets, and in data-analytic contexts such
as classifiers and recommendation systems.  I'll discuss several recent projects
that aim to explore this interface: (1) exploration-exploitation tradeoffs for
bandits that compete over a scarce resource; (2) Langevin diffusions for solving
Thompson sampling problems; and (3) economic perspectives on online control of
false-discovery rates.
